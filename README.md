## Installation

### New installation

1. [Download the latest webERP source code](https://github.com/timschofield/webERP/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Everything inside the folder you unzipped needs to be uploaded/copied to your webserver, for example, into your
   `public_html` or `www` or `html` folder (the folder will already exist on your webserver).
4. Create an empty database, taking note of your username, password, hostname, and database name.
   NB: the database user must have sufficient permissions to create triggers and functions.
5. In your browser, enter the address to your site, such as: www.example.com (or if you uploaded it into another subdirectory
   such as _foldername_ use www.example.com/foldername)
6. Follow the instructions that appear in your browser for installation.

### Upgrading

1. [Download the latest webERP source code](https://github.com/timschofield/webERP/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Backup the `config.php` script and `companies/` directory from your previous installation.
4. Everything inside the folder you unzipped needs to be uploaded/copied to your webserver, overwriting your previous installation.
5. Verify that the `config.php` script and `companies/` directory are intact, and if not, restore them from your backup.
6. In your browser, enter the address to your site, such as: www.example.com (or if you uploaded it into another subdirectory such as foldername use www.example.com/foldername).
7. After you log-in, if any database upgrades are required, you will be prompted to install them.
